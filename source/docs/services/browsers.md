# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [DuckDuckGo Desktop browser for Windows](https://duckduckgo.com/windows) focuses on privacy that is not based on Chromium (as most would expect). Instead it relies on OS-provided rendering engines to build the browser (mostly WebKit). This makes it possible to remove all the unnecessary stuff usually available with popular web browsers.
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a fork of Firefox focused on privacy, security, and freedom, only available for desktop operating systems.

If the browser you choose is less secure and privacy-friendly, lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
