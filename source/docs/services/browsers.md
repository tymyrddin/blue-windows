# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a fork of Firefox focused on privacy, security, and freedom, only available for desktop operating systems.

If the browser you choose is not secure and privacy-friendly, [lock down the browser and the software it can invoke](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/README).
