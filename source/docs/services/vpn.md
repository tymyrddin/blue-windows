# Use a VPN service

* Internet providers are collecting your browsing data and handing this over to third parties (US, UK, Australia, 
and much of Europe). 
* Public Wi-Fi remains a serious threat with adversaries targeting unsuspecting users.
* Many streaming services and websites restrict content to certain geographic locations. A VPN allows you to bypass 
such restrictions.

A VPN will encrypt the connection and make the traffic unreadable.
