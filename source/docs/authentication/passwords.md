# Make that more secure passwords

* Do not use a password you have used in the past.
* Try to change the password at least every 3-6 months.
* Create a password that is at least six characters long.
* Create a password with both digits and letters, uppercase, and lowercase. 
* Do not create a password with a family name, name of your pet, hobby, sports teams, favourite TV show, etc.
* Do not create a password that is your phone number, house number, etc.
* Create a password that is not in a dictionary.
* Create passwords with spaces and/or magics (&*^%$#) in them (if allowed).

Have a [password manager](password-manager.md) create a password for you.
