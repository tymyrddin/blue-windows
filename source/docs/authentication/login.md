# Secure your login

## Switch to a local login account

Windows 10 Home will default to your Windows account, as this makes it easier to log in across all devices with one 
account. If, say, your mail credentials were compromised, then your machine would also be compromised.

## Set password if not exists

When you purchase a new Windows computer or if you have reformatted the computer with a fresh copy of Windows, the 
system will allow the user to login automatically without having the need to provide a password. This can prove costly 
because it gives opportunity for anyone to access information from your computer.

It is perhaps annoying to have to enter your password every boot, but it is a small price for making it harder 
for someone to get into your account and access your system:

* Settings -> Account 
* From the left column select Sign-in options
* Under Password click on Add, provide the password you wish to have and click on Finish
    
This will ensure that the computer is password protected.

## Add Secure Sign-In

Programs such as malware and viruses can gain access to your login information by imitating the sign-in screen. As a 
user, it is impossible to tell whether the sign-in screen is safe to use or not. Windows 10 Secure Sign-In is not the 
"one solution to solve all problems", but it cuts the root of this particular problem by blocking programs from 
displaying a fake sign-in screen.

* Type netplwiz in the search box and press Enter. This will open the User Accounts panel.
* Select the user that you want to enable Secure Sign-In for.
* Go to the Advanced tab and select "Require users to press Ctrl + Alt + Delete".
* Apply

Now, every time you start your computer, Windows will require you to press the key combination before entering your 
login details.
