# Require a password when resuming

A screensaver password and a sleep/stand-by password are different settings. 

## Screensaver

It is likely that your screensaver starts up before your computer goes to sleep, so that may be a better choice on a 
desktop. 

* In searchbox type "Change screen saver", then press Enter.
* In the Screen Saver Settings window, check the box On resume, display logon screen.
* OK

## Sleep/stand-by

A laptop is put to sleep when by closing the lid. A screensaver would not be active, and a screensaver password 
not needed.

For a sleep/stand-by password:

* Control Panel -> Power Options
* On the left choose Require a password on wakeup
* You may have to click the link that says “Change settings that are currently unavailable”
* Select Require a password

You will be able to wake the computer with your [local password](login.md).
