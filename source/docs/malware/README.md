# Introduction

Windows has been struggling with malware for years and thus has decent protection layers built-in. Microsoftâ€™s 
Defender is pretty good at detecting malware files, blocking exploits and network-based attacks, and flagging phishing 
sites. It even includes simple PC performance and health reports as well as parental controls with content filtering, 
usage limitations, and location tracking.

Its malware detection rates are lower than for many third-party competitors and content filters are 
limited to the Microsoft Edge browser.

Common signs of Windows 10 malware:

* Ads pop up in unexpected places, frequently
* Machine is running slower than usual
* Machine is consuming more power than necessary
* Strange behaviour, such as installing programs without your consent, even after rebooting it.
