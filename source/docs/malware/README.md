# Introduction

Windows has been struggling with malware for years and thus has decent protection layers built-in. Microsoftâ€™s 
Defender is pretty good at detecting malware files, blocking exploits and network-based attacks, and flagging phishing 
sites. It even includes simple PC performance and health reports as well as parental controls with content filtering, 
usage limitations, and location tracking.

And it is not enough. Malware detection rates are lower than for many third-party competitors and content filters are 
limited to the Microsoft Edge browser.

Common signs of Windows 10 malware:

* Ads pop up in unexpected places, frequently
* Machine is running slower than usual
* Machine is consuming more power than necessary
* Strange behaviour, such as installing programs without your consent, even after rebooting it.

And if your Windows machine gets infected with ransomware, it will be pretty obvious. You will get a demand to pay a 
ransom, and will find your files or drives encrypted and impossible to open, and most likely you will see a ransom 
message.

* If you are worried your machine might be infected, [scan and clean your machine](clean-machine.md).
* You can also [check the Windows registry for malware and remove it](clean-registry.md).
