# Find and clean machine

## Automagically

Choose your scanner carefully, have a look at [AV Comparatives' test results for Windows](https://www.av-comparatives.org/consumer/test-results/microsoft-windows/).

## Manually

Disconnect from the internet.

### Switch to Safe Mode

1. Go to Updates & Security -> Recovery
2. Choose “Restart now” in the Advanced startup section
3. When your machine restarts, a blue screen with a few options will appear 
4. Troubleshoot -> Advanced options -> Startup settings -> Restart
5. Another blue window appears, find the “Enable Safe Mode” option. Click number 4 on your keyboard.

### Check for unwanted applications

1. Go to Control Panel -> Uninstall a program
2. Check with DuckDuckGo whether unknown applications are legitimate or not
3. If the issue is recent, you can click on “Installed on” to find any newly installed programs that might be suspicious
5. If they are not, or if you are suspicious, delete them and empty your Trash

Note that this does not help with Trojans. These are evil files made to look like legitimate apps.  

### Delete temporary files 

1. Open the RUN window
2. Type "%temp%" and click "OK"
3. Delete all files and folders that are in this destination
4. Empty trash

Connect back to the internet.
