## Using IrfanView

This may become complicated if needing to remove EXIF data on multiple images from a complete folder. 

[IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) is a free image viewer software and photos that also gives the possibility to 
remove all data from an image or photo file. When saving an image, an option "Keep Original EXIF data" is 
present. Unchecking the option removes all EXIF data from the image file. Can be done in bulk. From the File 
-> Batch Conversion / rename menu, data on several image files can be deleted in one click.
