# Turning devices on and off

Adversaries can try to gain access with trojans - invisibly-installed malware that gives the adversary administrative 
control over targeted computers, including, the ability to remotely control devices. Depending on your location and 
context, you may want to turn devices off and later on again.

## Examples

### Turning cam off/on

It is better to have computer camera switched off. Here are the steps to disable camera access:

* From the left menu click on Camera and toggle the button to turn off the camera access any applications
* To allow access to any specific applications that need camera access, under the “Choose app that can access and send email” select the application and toggle for camera access
