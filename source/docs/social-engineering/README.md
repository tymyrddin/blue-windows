# Introduction

## Phishing & email 

* Be wary of emails asking for confidential information.
* Don't get pressured into providing sensitive information. Phishers like to use [all kinds of social engineering](attack-trees:docs/social-engineering/README). Learn what you can about it.
* Check a website's privacy policy, especially whether it will or will not sell its mailing list. If so, do not register.
* Watch out for generic-looking requests for information.
* Never submit confidential information via forms embedded within email messages.
* Never use links in an email to connect to a website unless you are absolutely sure they are authentic.
* If and when using software, do not rely on it. Stay aware, awake and alert.

## Browsing

Keyloggers and other malware can be installed via a web page script which exploits a browser vulnerability. The program will automatically be launched when a user visits an infected site. Compromising a browser is relatively easy, and it is cross-platform, hence an often chosen target. Plus that browsers (for performance reasons) prefetch exposing users to more security risks by downloading more pages, or from un-requested sites (additionally compounded as drive-by downloads become more advanced and diverse).

## Downloading and torrenting

A noted approach is to put malware up on sites labelled as something people want, such as “My caek loves YOU! 2 DVDRip.avi”. When downloading, it’s an avi, but it’s also bound with malware. And the caek isn’t real to begin with. For windows binding malware to an avi file isn’t even necessary because windows extensions are hidden by default, so they can just name it ''file.avi'' when in reality it’s ''file.avi.exe''. The caek is still not real and happiness is not just around the corner.
 
Download and torrent only from trusted sources and [check the integrity of downloads](data-mitigations:docs/filetransfer/Checking-integrity-of-downloads). 


## Fail

Can happen of course. [Clean machine](../malware/README.md).
