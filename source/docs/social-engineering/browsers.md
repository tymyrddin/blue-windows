# Browsers

Many of the browser vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks and abuses mentioned need to be fixed by the developers of browsers and web applications, which arenâ€™t much under the direct control of users, but users are not entirely powerless.

* View the metadata browsers are sending
* Check extensions/add-ons/plugins for known vulnerabilities
* Change default browser settings to [exclude cookies](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/Cookies) and [FLoC](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/FLoC), since they can be used to build up detailed profiles of surfing patterns over time.
* Use private browsing.
* Use the rest of [safer browsing](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/README) also.
* Use [networked or single-point anonymisers](data-mitigations:docs/traffic/README) to obscure identifying information.
* Security awareness training
* BeEF & other browser exploits not using browser vulnerabilities, rely on javascript. Lock down the browser and the software it can invoke. Install the NoScript plugin/extension.
* Tighten associated application settings to disable unwanted features and to configure trust zones.
